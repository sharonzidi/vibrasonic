# vibrasonic
The code is used for one of my tangible interaction design project--VibraSonic. VibraSonic is a tactile and wearable device designed for the hearing impaired to experience music. It takes music and converts the waveforms into vibrations in real time for the fingers to feel, rather than hear.
